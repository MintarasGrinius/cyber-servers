# Cyber Servers

Tiny app to manage you servers

## Planed works

- Move servers filtering form FE to BE when BE supports this
- Add pagination when BE supports this
- Add Sentry logging so error can be monitored
- Localize strings
- Github actions for building
- Github actions for running tests
- Some better design...
- Not happy with token storage in local store would love to implement
  something like HTTP-only Cookies if backend supports this.

Many planed works ar blocked by:
- Expand Backend
  - To support filtering
  - To support pagination
